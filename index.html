    <p>Overview</p>
    <p>With the dataset provided for heart analysis, I will analyse the possibilities of heart attack on the these features: Age, Gender, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Fasting Blood Sugar. That means I will use data from 165 people who are at high risk and figure out the relationship between these characteristics and the high risk of heart attack.</p>
    <p>Questions to be answered:</p>
    <p>1.	Does the age of a person contribute towards heart attack?</p>
    <p>2.	Does gender (male/female)  increase the risk of heart attack?</p>
    <p>3.	Are the resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar related to the high risk of heart attack?</p>
